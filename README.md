# k-means

This excercise is based on Irfan Noordin class - 'Kuala Lumpur School of AI Machine Learning 101 class on 06/04/2019'
https://github.com/irfan017/KLSAI-ML-101

Some changes was made, by removing the 'Class' column from original data, to make the exercise more towards problem solving, by having the unknown data, need to find solution to cluster/group the data using k-means in Python.
