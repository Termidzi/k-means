# k-means

This excercise is based on Irfan Noordin class - 'Kuala Lumpur School of AI Machine Learning 101 class on 06/04/2019'
https://github.com/irfan017/KLSAI-ML-101

Some changes was made, by removing the 'Class' column from original data.
By having the unknown data, help me more towards finding solution to cluster/group the data using k-means in Python.
